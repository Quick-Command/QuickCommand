## Stretch technology: 
After considerations of data structure based on wireframing, We began a preliminary period of research on using Redux toolkit to manage our components' state.  
It was evident that using the redux toolkit is an extension of the initial idea of using redux.  The idea of implementing thunks seemed a challenge that could potentially lead us into deeper waters than we were comfortable navigating. As a team, we made a difficult decision to scout and come together with the intention of moving forward into what seemed a bit overwhelming at first glance.  This focus on working together lifted the burdens we have felt on previous projects and our front-end collaborative experience lifting eachother up in learning was paramount to the success we have realized in our journey into a new workflow and coding framework.

## Workflows:
This project has given us a new look at how to work together in continuous innovation that shows empathy for other developers.  
* We are utilizing git rebase for each pull request to allow our merge commits to be succinct.  
* We have used Travis CI to continuously integrate our work and ensure testability.
* We are building our remote heroku app with each merge into main
* We are using TDD with Cypress and testing before public branch merging to stay informed about optimal functionality throughout the app.

## Stretch Goals:
In the limited timeframe we have to make determined sprints and complete our intended phases to reach an MVP, we have limited the features needed to the principle functionality. In our last phase, we will make sure to include some basic features that we feel are important in the user flow:
* A wallet card or passport of the user's information that will allow them access to the site and emergency contact information.
* A component for weather that will alert the commander and personnel on what to expect on-site.
* A route that offers more in-depth analysis of the site and instructions based on the incident chosen
